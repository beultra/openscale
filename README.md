# Introduction:
The Decent Open Scale is a full open sourced(software/hardware/cad design) BLE scale. Currently you can use it with de1app and Decent Espresso machine. But with Decent Scale API, you can use it for anything.<br />
To make it work, you need at least an ESP32 for MCU, a Loadcell for weighing, an HX711 for Loadcell ADC, a SSD1306 for OLED display, a MPU6050 for gyro function.<br />
If you want to use it unplugged, you'll also need a 3.7v battery.<br />
If you only want to burn the firmware, please read How to upload HEX file.<br />
