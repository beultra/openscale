# Print Step Files Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for printing components from STEP files. Ensure you follow the recommendations for materials and slicer software to achieve the best results for your prints.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [OrcaSlicer](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer) *(Link to download Orca Slicer)*
- [PrusaSlicer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer) *(Link to download PrusaSlicer)*
- [BambuStudio](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio) *(Link to download Bambu Studio)*

## Instructions

### Opening STEP Files

1. **Choose a Slicer:** Start by opening either Orca Slicer, PrusaSlicer, or Bambu Studio on your computer.
2. **Import STEP File:** Locate the option to import or open a file in the slicer software. Select the STEP file you wish to print.

### Material Selection

Different parts of the model require different materials for optimal results:

- **TPU:** Print the battery strap, rubber feet, and top pad with TPU for flexibility and durability.
- **ABS:** The top casing and bottom casing should be printed with ABS to ensure structural integrity and heat resistance.

#### Important Notes on Materials:
- **PETG:** PETG may be suitable for some components, offering a good balance between flexibility and strength. Test individual parts for suitability.
- **PLA:** Avoid using PLA, as it may not provide the necessary durability or heat resistance for the components.
